# Unity 3D Mathematical Surfaces – Learning Project & Tutorial

This is a learning project based on Jasper Flick’s [Catlike Coding Unity tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/).
This project is a part of my Unity learning journey, focused on understanding **basic GameObject manipulation** and **C# scripting**.  
It implements a **3D Mathematical Surfaces** in Unity that shows how Function Wave behave on 2D grid and Visualize 3D shapes with Mathematical Functions.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me understand and apply:

- ✅ Create a Function Library
- ✅ Use a Delegation and an enumeration type
- ✅ Display 2D Function with Cubes grid
- ✅ Defines surfaces in 3D shapes
- ✅ Making 3D Functions
- ✅ Animating 3D shapes using mathematical function

## 🎓 Purpose

This is part of a personal learning portfolio.  
The goal is to **document my progress in graphics programming with Unity** — starting from beginner-friendly concepts like this clock, and eventually moving toward shaders, physics, and custom rendering.

---

## 🕹️ Project Overview

- 3D scene with a simple clock model
- Rotating hands synchronized to real time
- Hour, minute, and second hands rotate independently
- Written entirely in C# using MonoBehaviour

## 💼 Portfolio Use

This repository is part of my programming and Unity development portfolio.  
All code was written and structured by me based on basic Unity documentation and experimentation.

I’ll continue adding more projects to showcase my growth — each with its own GitHub repository and learning summary.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Unity 2022+ (Built-in Render Pipeline)
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub for version control
